In this project, I leveraged Power BI to craft a dynamic and insightful visualization of Bones and Joints Cancer patterns. 
Working with extensive cancer data spanning 27 years, I applied ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) techniques to clean and organize the data.
The result was a powerful and interactive dashboard that provides a clear overview of cancer trends over time.
By combining my skills in data analysis and Power BI, I was able to present a detailed and user-friendly report,
contributing valuable insights for understanding and addressing Bones and Joints Cancer.

This project not only showcased my proficiency in data visualization but also demonstrated the capability of Power BI 
in presenting complex healthcare data in an accessible and meaningful way. The endeavor was well-received by mentors and senior members,
validating the effectiveness of data-driven approaches in understanding and combating diseases.
